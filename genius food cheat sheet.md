# Genius Food Cheat Sheet
I read the book [Genius Foods](https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Foods-Smarter-Productive-Protecting/dp/0062562851) and found it fairly convincing. Some of its claims seem a bit premature given how new some of the research is (and given how historically shitty nutritional science has been). But overall it was good.

__Problem summary__. The agricultural revolution, while great for reproductive success, was terrible for long-term health. It only got worse with our modern western diet, which overfeeds us on carbs and starves us of vital nutrients, which increases dementia, heart disease, diabetes, etc. For the first time in decades our life expectancy is decreasing. 

__Solution summary__.

1. Eat the foods listed below (protein & fat > carbs).
2. Sleep well.
3. Avoid alcohol & junk food.
4. Lift weights.
5. Go on hikes.
6. Fast intermittently (12 to 8 is good).

# Always Foods
Stock up on this shit. Eat liberally with every meal. If losing weight, reduce oils & butter. Otherwise, in theory, you don't need to count calories because you'll feel full and energized while maintaining a caloric deficit. You shouldn't need to snack too much either.

1. __Veggies__:
   1. *dark leafy greens (romaine, kale, spinach, cabbage)
   2. *broccoli
   3. onions, garlic
2. __Oils & fats__:

# Sometimes Foods
Eat in moderation. You can eat more if you exercise a lot. Especially just after exercising.

1. __Starchy root vegetables__: white potatoes, sweet potatoes
2. __Non-gluten-containing unprocessed grains__: rice, quinoa, oatmeal, popcorn
3. __Dairy__: milk, organic cheeses, probiotic yogurt
4. __Legumes__: Beans, lentils, peas, chickpeas, hummus, peanuts
5. __Sweeteners__: Stevia

# Supplements
1. __Vitamin D__. I'm certainly not getting it in my office basement. Aim for 2000 to 5000 IU daily.
2. __Fish oil__. My family won't eat fish. Aim for 500 milligrams DHA and 1000 milligrams EPA daily.

# Diet tips
1. __Organic__: Prefer foods labeled "100% Organic", "Organic", or "USDA Organic" - these labels are federally regulated.
2. __Veggies__: Your volume should be dominated by veggies. Just add them to every meal.
3. __Daily big-ass salads__: Eat one everyday. Use a big bowl and go crazy with the above foods. Lather it in extra-virgin olive oil.
4. __Low-carb transition__: It takes ~2 weeks to transition to a low-carb diet as the body reduces its insulin. It can feel similar to quitting a drug. Eating extra salt can help during the transition.
